I would like to especially thank the following projects and people:

- `LKDDb <https://cateee.net/lkddb/>`_ for providing the awesome Linux Kernel Driver Database (which is used for option detection)
- `KSSP <https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project/Recommended_Settings>`_ for the great list of kernel hardening options
- `CLIP OS <https://docs.clip-os.org/clipos/kernel.html#configuration>`_ for their well documented and well chosen kernel options
- `kconfig-hardened-check <https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check>`_ for the collection of options from several kernel hardening resources
